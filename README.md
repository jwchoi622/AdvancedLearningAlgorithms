7/30 - Rectified Linear Activation Function (ReLU)

7/31 - Labs on the Softmax Function and Multiclass classification

8/1 - Labs on derivatives and Backprop. It was a good review of derivatives and the end of week 2 content. 

8/2 - 8/3 - Worked on Assignment for Week 2

8/4 - Preparing the data for building a model, testing the model and selecting the best one 

8/5 - Fixing high bias (underfit) and high variance (overfit) 

8/6 - Assignment for Week 3

8/8 - 8/9 - Redoing Assignment 3

8/10 - Decision Trees, Information Gain and Regression Trees

8/11 - Using pandas to one-hot encode a dataset. Using scikit-learn to implement Random Forest, Decision Tree and XGBoost 

8/13 - Assignment 4

8/15 - Finished Assignment 4 on entropy and information gain. Kept getting an assertion error for the compute_information_gain function. Nan values instead of 0.0 for information gain kept giving me an error. The NaN values were coming from the compute_entropy function. I wasn't able to fix that function but just made the compute_information_gain function return 0.0 when a NaN value for entropy was being used.
